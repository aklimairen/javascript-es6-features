### **Template Literals**

Template literals in JavaScript make it easier and more understandable to build strings containing both fixed text and dynamic values, as well as multi-line strings.
To utilize template literals, wrap the text in backticks ('') rather than standard single (' ') or double (" ") quotations. Wrap variables or expressions in ${} to incorporate them immediately within these backticks.

This Wraping variables or expressions  characteristic is referred to as interpolation. Interpolation is the process of inserting or embedding dynamic values or variables into a string.
This enables you to generate strings that incorporate the outcomes of expressions, variable values, or function outputs efficiently into the text.

**Without interpolation:**

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
console.log(greeting); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

**With interpolation (using template literals):**

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const greeting = Hello, ${name}!;
console.log(greeting); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

As you can see, interpolation with template literals is more concise and easier to read.

### **Destructuring**

ES6 introduces destructuring, a straightforward method for extracting values from arrays or objects and assigning them to individual variables. This makes your code more understandable and adaptable.
The destructuring syntax operates on the left side of the assignment, where you specify which values or properties to extract and how to assign them to variables.
It is extremely handy for minimizing repetitive code and improving assignment readability!

#### Basic Array Destructuring

Array destructuring in JavaScript lets you extract values from an array and assign them to variables in a straightforward and understandable manner. The values are unpacked according to their position in the array.

**Without destructuring:**

```javascript
// Without destructuring
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
const first = numbers[0];
const second = numbers[1];
console.log(first, second); // Outputs: 10 20
```

**With destructuring:**

```javascript
// With destructuring
const [firstNum, secondNum] = [10, 20, 30];
console.log(firstNum, secondNum); // Outputs: 10 20
```

#### **Basic Object restructuring**

Object destructuring in JavaScript allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables in a simple and comprehensible way. The properties are unpacked according to their keys.

**Without destructuring:**

```javascript
// Without destructuring
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
console.log(name, age); // Outputs: Alice 25
```

**With destructuring:**

```javascript
// With destructuring
const { name, age } = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(name, age); // Outputs: Alice 25
```

### **Object literals**

Object literals in JavaScript are a straightforward and fast way to generate and handle objects.
They have become more concise and powerful as a result of ES6 advancements. These improvements include shorthand property names, which allows you to build object properties straight from variables with the same name, minimizing redundancy.

Before ES6:

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 25;

const user = { name: name, age: age };
console.log(user); // Outputs: { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }

```

ES6+:

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 25;

const user = { name, age };
console.log(user); // Outputs: { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }
```

### **for of loop**

The for...of loop iterates across the values of an iterable (such as arrays, strings, or sets) sequentially.
Each step of the loop is referred to as an iteration, and the current value goes to a loop variable.

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
for (const num of numbers) {
  console.log(num); // Outputs: 10, 20, 30
}
```

Compared to a traditional for loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]); // Outputs: 10, 20, 30
}
```

Benefits of for...of Over a Traditional for Loop

- Simpler and more readable: Eliminates the need for index variables.
- Works with any iterable: Compatible with arrays, strings, maps, sets, and other iterables.
- Avoids index management: No need to track start, end, or increment conditions.
- Less error-prone: Reduces common mistakes like off-by-one errors.
- Focuses on values: Directly accesses values without using indices.
- No length dependency: Iterates through all elements automatically.

### Spread Operator

The spread operator in JavaScript is a convenient syntax introduced in ES6 to expand or spread elements of an iterable (like arrays, strings, or objects) into individual elements or properties. It is denoted by three consecutive dots (...) and can be used in a variety of ways.

Combining arrays or objects, copying them without changing the original, and passing array elements as inputs to functions are examples of common use cases. Additionally, it can be used to separate strings into individual characters and to update or combine existing collections to create new ones.

**Expanding Arrays**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5]; // Combines arrays
console.log(newNumbers); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Copying Arrays**

```javascript
const original = [1, 2, 3];
const copy = [...original];
console.log(copy); // Outputs: [1, 2, 3]
```

**Combining Objects**

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const updates = { age: 26, city: "New York" };
const updatedUser = { ...user, ...updates };
console.log(updatedUser); // Outputs: { name: 'Alice', age: 26, city: 'New York' }
```

**Function Arguments**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
console.log(sum(...numbers)); // Outputs: 6
```

**String to Characters**

```javascript
const word = "hello";
const chars = [...word];
console.log(chars); // Outputs: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

Benefits of spread operator

* It helps you to manipulate arrays and objects effortlessly and simply.
* Provides an easy way to copy or merge arrays and objects.
* Simplifies working with arguments and iterables.

### Rest Operator

A rest operator is a type of parameter that gets all of the remaining parameters of a function call via an Array. It enables us to handle a variety of inputs as parameters in a function. This is particularly useful when you don't know how many arguments a function will receive.

Common Use Cases

**Function Arguments**

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Outputs: 10
```

**Array Destructuring**

```javascript
const [first, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(first); // Outputs: 10
console.log(rest);  // Outputs: [20, 30, 40]
```

**Object Destructuring**

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };
const { name, ...details } = user;
console.log(name);    // Outputs: Alice
console.log(details); // Outputs: { age: 25, city: 'New York' }
```

Key Points:

* The rest parameter must be the last parameter in the function's parameter list.
* It can be used to collect any number of arguments, including zero.
* The collected arguments are always an array, even if only one argument is passed.

### Arrow Functions

When creating a function in JavaScript, the main syntax is to use the function keyword followed by the function name. Arrow functions provide a simple syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They use the => (arrow) syntax and were introduced in ES6 as a modern replacement for the typical function keyword.

When you declare a function using the arrow function syntax, you must assign the declaration to a variable to give the function a name.

**Basic Syntax:**

```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => expressionOrBlock;
```

If the function contains a single expression, you can omit braces and the `return` keyword.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

For single-line expressions, the result is returned automatically. This is known as Implicit return

```javascript
const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object but can use rest parameters (`...args`) instead.

```javascript
const sum = (...nums) => nums.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Outputs: 10
```

Benefits of arrow function:

* Shorter and cleaner syntax for defining functions.
* Arrow functions make callbacks more readable.
* Reduces code for one-line expressions or Implicit return.

### Default Parameters

If no value or undefined is given, default function parameters can be used to initialise named parameters with default values.

Basic Syntax:

```javascript
function functionName(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) {
  // Function body
}
```

In ES6, you can assign default values to function parameters directly in the function's declaration. If the function is called without passing a value for the parameter or if the argument is explicitly `undefined`, the default value will be used.

```javascript
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet());        // Outputs: Hello, Guest!
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

Benefits of default parameters:

* Simplifies code by avoiding manual checks for `undefined` values.
* Reduces the need for workarounds like `param = param || defaultValue`.
* Makes function behavior more predictable and easier to read.

### Class

Classes are "special functions," and similarly like function expressions and function declarations, a class can be declared in two ways: a class expression and a class declaration.

Basic Syntax:

```javascript
class ClassName {
  constructor(parameters) {
    // Initialize properties
  }

  methodName() {
    // Method logic
  }
}

```

In ES6, classes give a more structured and straightforward way to build objects and handle inheritance in JavaScript. They add syntactic sugar to traditional prototype-based inheritance while making code more legible and organised.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  describe() {
    return `${this.name} is ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

const alice = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(alice.describe()); // Outputs: Alice is 25 years old.

```

**Key Features of ES6 Classes**

* **Constructor** : Special method for initializing object properties, automatically called when a new instance is created.
* **Methods** : Functions defined inside a class, without needing the `function` keyword.
* **Inheritance** : Use `extends` to create subclasses and `super` to access parent class methods or constructor.
* **Static Methods** : Defined with `static`, can be called on the class directly without creating an instance.
* **Getters and Setters** : Allow you to define accessors for class properties to encapsulate logic while accessing or updating values.
* **Class Syntax** : Provides a clean, structured, and modern way to define and manage objects compared to prototype-based inheritance.

Benefits of ES6 Classes

* **Improved Readability** : Provides a clean and structured syntax for defining objects and inheritance.
* **Encapsulation** : Groups related data and methods together, making the code modular.
* **Inheritance Simplification** : Makes inheritance more intuitive with `extends` and `super`.
* **Support for Static Methods** : Useful for utility functions.
* **Modern Syntax** : Aligns JavaScript with object-oriented programming concepts used in other languages.

### **Let & Const**

ES6 introduces two new keywords for variable declaration: let and const. These keywords improve on the usual var by giving improved scoping, immutability options, and minimising common JavaScript potential dangers.

**let:**

* Used to declare variables that can be **reassigned** but are  **block-scoped** .
* A **block** is defined by `{}` (e.g., inside functions, loops, or conditional statements).
* Prevents redeclaration within the same scope.

  ```javascript
  let age = 25;
  age = 30; // Reassignment is allowed
  console.log(age); // Outputs: 30

  {
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
  }
  // console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined (block-scoped)
  ```

**const:**

* Used to declare  **constants** , meaning the variable cannot be **reassigned** after initialization.
* Like `let`, `const` is also  **block-scoped** .
* **Immutable Binding** : The reference cannot be changed, but if it's an object or array, its properties or elements can still be modified.

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
// name = "Bob"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

const user = { age: 25 };
user.age = 30; // Allowed: Properties of the object can be changed
console.log(user.age); // Outputs: 30
```

**Key Differences Between `var`, `let`, and `const`**

| Feature                 | `var`               | `let`                  | `const`                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Scope**         | Function-scoped       | Block-scoped             | Block-scoped             |
| **Redeclaration** | Allowed               | Not allowed              | Not allowed              |
| **Reassignment**  | Allowed               | Allowed                  | Not allowed              |
| **Hoisting**      | Hoisted but undefined | Hoisted but inaccessible | Hoisted but inaccessible |

Benefits of let and const

* **Avoids Redeclaration Bugs** : Helps prevent unintentional overwriting of variables in the same scope.
* **Better Scoping** : Block scope makes variables more predictable and prevents scope leakage.
* **Encourages Immutability** : `const` promotes the use of immutable references, leading to safer and more robust code.
* **Cleaner Syntax** : Easier to understand intent (`const` for constants, `let` for mutable variables).

### Export and Import

##### Export

ES6 introduces a module structure that allows developers to export and import code from other files. This modular approach increases code organisation, reuse, and maintainability.

The export keyword transfers variables, functions, classes, or other values from one file to another. There are two categories of exports. Named and Default Exports

**Named Export**

Multiple things can be exported, each with its own name and must be imported with the same names.

```javascript
// file: mathUtils.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
```

**Default Exports**

Default Export Allows you to export a single default value (e.g., a function, class, or object). Can be imported with any name.

```javascript
// file: greet.js
export default function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

##### Import

The import statement is used to include variables, functions, or classes that were exported from another module. These imported values are known as live bindings because they are automatically updated when the original module changes. However, you cannot reassign these imported values in the same file where they were imported.

**Importing Named Exports**

Use curly braces `{}` and match the exported names exactly.

```javascript
// file: main.js
import { add, subtract } from './mathUtils.js';
console.log(add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8
console.log(subtract(5, 3)); // Outputs: 2
```

**Importing Default Exports**

No curly braces are needed. You can rename the import freely.

```javascript
// file: main.js
import greet from './greet.js';
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

**Importing All as an Object**

Use `* as` to import everything from a file as a single object.

```javascript
// file: main.js
import * as math from './mathUtils.js';
console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
console.log(math.subtract(5, 3)); // Outputs: 2
```
